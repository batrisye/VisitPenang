            text="Built by Captain Francis Light following his settlement of Penang Island (then 
            known as Prince of Wales Island), the fort was established in 1786. When news of war 
            between France and England broke out in 1793, the original wooden structure was replaced 
            with a brick building in anticipation of an attack. Its fortifications and weapons increased 
            as the years went by, including the addition of a lighthouse in 1914. Dilapidation of the 
            fort began at the end of World War II, however it has since been restored and declared a National 
            Heritage site in 1976. Thanks to its rich history, the fort also played a crucial role in securing 
            George Townâ€™s UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2008."
